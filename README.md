# Basics [How to program 101]

Each one of the exercises in this report will show you what you need to do to write good basic code. I do not expect you to know how to write any code at the start, so this will be a good refresher for those who already know how to write code. If you are more advanced, then I will point out more ways to optimize your code, so please do try to make these exercises as efficient as possible from a computational standpoint.

## ex0 [branches]:

To start each of you will have to create a branch with hello world program, written in C. within the ex0. Then you need to actually push the branch to the origin.

## ex1 [How to Input and Output]:

ex1 is an exercise to make you use input output streams. Please take the input file and output the text and save it to the git repository. It must not take more than a second to run your program.

## ex2 [How to Performance]:

preface: You will be using a microcontroller sending and receiving values, the performance must be good and we need a way to measure it. This is created to show you what the performance looks like for a normal C program.

ex2 is an exercise that is testing your ability to check the performance of your programs. Take the program that you have from ex1 and perform performance tuning. Choose a tool to use to check the performance of your program and write a paragraph about your choices and why you made it.

## ex3 [Memory Issues]:

preface: On embedded devices you have a finite amount of memory. Keeping down the memory usage is important, and this exercise is made to show you how to use memory.

ex3 is an exercise to make you look at memory usage. Choose a tool to use to check the performance of your program and write a paragraph about your choices and why you made it.

## ex4 [How to use Coding A Style-Guide]:

Please read: https://developers.google.com/style to make sure that you read through at least https://developers.google.com/style/highlights and https://developers.google.com/style/api-reference-comments before continuing on to the next exercise. The point of this exercise is to.

## ex5 [Testing Code]:

Unit testing code is imparitive to the work that we do, for if we messed up people cod die. Try looking for a C based unit testing suite and try it out. cUnit, GNU Autounit, and Unity.
