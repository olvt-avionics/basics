For my tuning, I ran the basic visual studio diagnostic tools.  By using these tools I was able to measure the timing, process memory and CPU %.  I was able to track these values as I stepped through the program and see whether certain parts of the program were being overworked.  The maximum the Process Memory ever hit was around 880 KB which wasn't that high which is expected with this small of a program.  This however could be valuable for future programs.
