In my analysis of my ex1 program for memory efficiencies, I used the valgrind tool. I used this in my 
analysis of the program using the memcheck tool that is a part of the valgrind tool. In using this I was
able to see the stack size that my program uses, which can serve as a representation of the max amount of memory that the program uses.
