For my performance testing of the ex1 program, I used the diagnostic tools provided by MS Visual Studio 2019. In particular,
I checked the program runtime which was 54.5ms, far less than the required 1 second runtime. I also check CPU usage of the
main function which was 71.88% of the total usage. This makes sense as the while loop is where input_file.txt is read and
outputted. The total heap allocation for the program was 67.52KB, with an increase of 8.71KB after once the while loop began
and the input stream was opened.
