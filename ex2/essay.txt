For this exercise, I decided to use the tools perf and cppcheck. perf allowed me to measure cpu usage as well as look at the disassembly of my code. It also shows you which functions are used the most. As this was a really really simple program with just one function, main, most of the time was spent there.

The other tool I used was cppcheck. cppcheck is a static analyzer which I used on my cpp code. After running cppcheck, it noticed that there were a couple variables that I could reduce the scope for. These were variables used in side the while loop. I had initially left them out because I didn't want them being initialized for each iteration of the loop, but after doing a little research, it turns out that apparently, for primitives at least, the compiler is smart enough to only allocate memory for the variables once. Since reducing the scopes of variables is good practice, I moved them into the while loop.
