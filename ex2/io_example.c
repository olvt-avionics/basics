I chose the tool called Valgrind. This was my choice of performance analyzer for multiple reasons. First, the tool is supported
on mac osx which was most important to me. Additionally there is functionality such that it can perform various forms 
of analyses on the most common programming file types, including C filetypes. Also, this tool helps me check for memory leaks
and helps with debugging.
