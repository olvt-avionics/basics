	I'd want to run a test that tries to find the maximum amount of data that could be read from an input file with performance
	from the beginning of the read staying consistent or getting better towards the end of the read. Hence, I would want some
	sort of maximum capacity testing to ensure that I know just how much data can be inside the input file before the performance
	of my program begins to gradually decline. However, it would make more sense to simulate how much data will be in the file
	in real-time. Hence, load testing and peak load testing would be of the highest priority. Stress testing would also be
	good to run if at all possible. I chose these load tests because they can best simulate the actual environment I would
	want my program to run in by simulating differing loads. The peak load will ensure that the program can still run at maximum
	capacity times. The other tests, from what I read, don't seem to fit well with ensuring that this program works well.
	The program only reads and outputs a file with data. The biggest priority is making sure that any amount of data in the
	file can be read with quick execution.
